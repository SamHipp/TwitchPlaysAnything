# TwitchPlaysAnything

We've all heard of Twitch Plays Pokemon, but what if anyone could do that sort of thing with any progrma they'd like, and then have saveable profiles for each one? That's where Twitch Plays Anything comes in! Currently under construction, this will be a Windows program that allows streamers to do exactly that. 

First alpha release coming soon!

Feel free to clone the project yourself and make a merge request if you want. I have some issues created already, but if you have any other ideas then go for it! The more smart minds and good ideas going for this, the merrier!
